# Marlin 3D printer firmware for the Ender 3.

This repository mainly exists to let me build it remotely, because I often use my iPad to edit firmware changes due to my printer's location, so I'm looking for an alternative to rdping in to my main machine.

| Hardware   | Details  | URLs  | 
|---|---|---|
| Printer  |  Creality Ender-3S (Basically an Ender 3, pre-built, taobao) |   | 
| Sensor   |  Authentic Creality BLTouch  |   |
| Fan Duct  | Satsana 5015 Remix  | [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4647053)  |

All other parts are stock.
